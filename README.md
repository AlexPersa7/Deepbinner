#### Pre-trained models

Deepbinner currently only provides pre-trained models for the [EXP-NBD103 native barcoding kit](https://store.nanoporetech.com/native-barcoding-kit-1d.html). These models (one for the starts of reads, one for the ends of reads) were trained on native barcoded runs sequenced using the [SQK-LSK108 1D ligation kit](https://store.nanoporetech.com/ligation-sequencing-kit-1d.html) from both R9.4 (a.k.a. FLO-MIN106) and R9.5 (a.k.a. FLO-MIN107) flow cells. If you have similar data, then Deepbinner should work nicely!

If you have different data (e.g. sequenced using the [SQK-RBK004 rapid barcoding kit](https://store.nanoporetech.com/rapid-barcoding-kit.html)), then pre-trained models aren't available. If you have lots of existing data, you can [train your own network](https://github.com/rrwick/Deepbinner/blob/master/training_instructions.md). Alternatively, if you can share your available data with me, I could train a model and make it available in Deepbinner. [Let me know!](https://github.com/rrwick/Deepbinner/issues)
